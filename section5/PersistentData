# Persistent Data: Bind Mounting

# Maps a host file or directory to a container file or directory
# Basically just two locations pointing to the same file(s)
# Again, skips UFS, and host files overwrite any in container

# Can't use in Dockerfile, must be at container run

# ... run -v /Users/Owner/folderName:/path/container (mac/linux)
# ... run -v //c/Users/Owner/folderName:/path/container (windows)

docker container run -d --name nginx2 -p 80:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/shar/nginx/html nginx

# $(pwd) returns current working dir
