# Configure relationships between containers
# save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
# Create one-liner developer environment startups

# Docker Compose 2 parts:
    # YAML : containers, networks, volumes
    # A CLI tool docker-compose - used for local dev/test automation

docker-compose up
# setup volumes/networks and start all containers

docker-compose down
# stop all containers and remove cont/vol/net

# as we name 'Dockerfile' in docker, compose file should be
    'docker-compose.yml'

docker compose down -v
# not only stops all working files but also clears the volume created

# Build custom images 

docker-compose build
# build images if they are in cache

docker-commpose down -rmi local
# stop and also remove all images used
